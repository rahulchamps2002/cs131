Task 1:
a) I assume this command is attempting to find all the files in the /etc directory and route the output into the one.txt file. What gets routed into the two.txt file is the files we cannot see.
b) In the one.txt file, there is a list of files from the /etc directory and in the two.txt file there are files from the /etc directory we don't have permission to view or access.

Task 2:
As per the Dataset, Top 3 [Month, Year] with the most number of YouTube channels created were:
     1. Number of channels: 15  year,month: 2006,Mar
     2. Number of channels: 13  year,month: 2014,Jul
     3. Number of channels: 12  year,month: 2014,Aug
The command I used was cut -d ',' -f 20,21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv | sort -k1,1 | uniq -c | sort -k1,1nr | head -n3
cut -d ',' -f20,21 is a command used to determine that ',' is a separation between categories and print out the categories 20 and 21.
uniq -c is a command that counts all the uniq values of the categories we are viewing and counting how many times it appears.
sort -k1,1nr is a command used to sort the information from the cut command and the uniq -c values so that the largest numbers are on top and the smallest are on the bottom.
head -n3 is a command that returns the first three items of the sorted list.

Task 3:
Command used: ps -u rahulf23
    PID TTY          TIME CMD

1953325 pts/64   00:00:00 vim
1953418 pts/48   00:00:00 ps

I see that there is now a vim command added to the list of processes owned by me.
PID of vim: 1953325

    PID TTY          TIME CMD
1945904 ?        00:00:00 systemd
1945906 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
1945912 ?        00:00:00 sshd
1945913 pts/64   00:00:00 bash
1953150 ?        00:00:00 sshd
1953153 pts/48   00:00:00 bash
1954267 pts/48   00:00:00 ps

I see that the vim process is now gone and that happened because of me quitting the vim window.
